- Different colors for peptides in active cycle and on graph.  Allow me to choose the color for each active compound.
- [x] timescale of graph is off.  shows hours, represents days
- custom compounds and blends should go into custom section in Compounds and should be available as drop-down
- Cycle Planner should estimate total number of vials and supplies needed for cycle
- [x] Move Calculator to module and allow for selecting inventory and reconstituting
- Move Per-Compound and Supply Requirements in Cycles module up to top and include compound requirements
	- Deduct from inventory or make minimum vial requirements as active and remove from in-stock
- Supply Requirements should map to Supply inventory and Supply inventory needs to use the same drop-down for type
- [x] Cycle dosing log isn't tracking taken dosed events.  I have three logged events in the current cycle when it shows zero and 0% adherence
- Blends need to track each peptide in blend
- In compound view, order should be All, Active, Planned, In Stock, Reference
- Caculator units are off
